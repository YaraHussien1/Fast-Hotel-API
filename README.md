# FastHotel API

 ## Motivation
   * The problem domain is the transportation of customers to the closest (nearby ) hotel.
      The specific SOA solution was to make the customer able to find the closest hotel to his location. It also orders a taxi to give         him a ride to the hotel, and it takes care of the payment process with all its details.

 * Why use service computing?
    - Less cost.
    - Availability.
    - Better maintenance.
    - Reusability.
  
 * Why use composition?
      - We use composition because provides services for new software applications or ApiÂ´s.
  
 * Why these third parties?
    - Easy to use.
    - More documentation.
    - Free keys.
    - Stable and secure.

 ## Details
 ### Start : 
   * A cutomer needs to find a close hotel.
   
     - FastHotel API does the following :
     
         1- Gets the customer current location from the DataBase.
        
         2- Send the customer's current location to the Taxi service.
        
         #### 3- Parallel Search " FastHotel API and Taxi service : 
        
              * FastHotel searches for hotels that are close to the customer's current location.
          
              - Uses Places API and searches by raduis.
              
              - Uses Google Maps API to calculate the shortest hotel path " The closest hotel to the customer location".
              - Loop : If the result of searching by the raduis was null "no hotels within this raduis", then increase the raduis and                           search again until you find at least one hotel.
              
           * Taxi Service Searches for the path "Direction" to the customer in order to pick Him/Her up.
              - Uses Google Maps API.
              
        4- FastHotel Sends the directions of the hotel to the Taxi service.
        
        5- The Taxi picks up the customer and gives Him/Her a drive to the hotel.
        
        6- The customer makes a payment request, FastHotel sends the customer information to PayPal Api.
        
        7- PayPal API makes all the payment functions.

# Implementation Details
  We developed our service using the RESTful service development paradigm, which is based on the HTTP protocol that is an RPC- based       sychronous communication protocol.

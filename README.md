# FastHotel API

 ## Motivation
   * The problem domain is the transportation of customers to the closest (nearby ) hotel.
      The specific SOA solution was to make the customer able to find the closest hotel to his location. It also orders a taxi to give         him a ride to the hotel, and it takes care of the payment process with all its details.

 * Why use service computing?
    - Less cost.
    - Availability.
    - Better maintenance.
    - Reusability.
  
 * Why use composition?
      - We use composition because provides services for new software applications or ApiÂ´s.
  
 * Why these third parties?
    - Easy to use.
    - More documentation.
    - Free keys.
    - Stable and secure.

 ## Users can use FastHotel API functionalities provided by Web services API in the following order:
 
   1-  User sends a request(with his current location ) to FastHotel API.
   
   2-  FastHotel API gets the current location of the cusomer and finds the path (Direction) to the customer.
   
   4-  FastHotel API finds the closest hotel path (direction) to the customer using Google Places and Maps,                                      and sends the (customer location , hotel path) to a taxi.
   
   5-  The taxi picks up the customer, give him a drive to the hotel.

 ## Details
 ### Start : 
   * A customer needs to find a close hotel.
   
     - FastHotel API does the following :
     
      1- Gets the customer's current location from the DataBase.
        
      2- Send the customer's current location to the Taxi service.
         
      3- Parallel Search " FastHotel API and Taxi service"  : 
         
       #### A- FastHotel searches for hotels that are close to the customer's current location.
          
        - Uses Places API and searches by raduis.
               
        - Uses Google Maps API to calculate the shortest hotel path " The closest hotel to the customer location" .
        - Loop :
                -  If the result of searching by the raduis was null "no hotels within this raduis" , then increase the raduis and                           search again until you find at least one hotel.
              
       #### B- Taxi Service Searches for the path "Direction" to the customer in order to pick Him/Her up.
       
        - Uses Google Maps API.
              
      4- FastHotel Sends the directions of the hotel to the Taxi service.
        
      5- The Taxi picks up the customer and gives Him/Her a drive to the hotel.
        
      6- The customer makes a payment request, FastHotel sends the customer information to PayPal Api.
        
      7- PayPal API makes all the payment functions.

# Implementation Details
  We developed our service using the RESTful service development paradigm, which is based on the HTTP protocol that is an RPC- based       sychronous communication protocol.

# Composite Service Algorithm According To BPMN 2.0
